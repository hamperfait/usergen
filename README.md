# usergen

This repository contains various python scripts that generate usernames in different ways.

For now, it can only generate spanish IDs (DNI) which consist of 8 digits and a letter, and usernames.

####user_generator
The user_generator can receive a lot of different inputs, depending on how you want them to be generated.
You need to specify at least **ONE** input file, being this one the surname one.
It allows to:
- Specify the amount of characters from each file
- Add a year or a range of year in the end (Hint: If you want to add random numbers, this works too!)
-- Specify how many digits from that year you want to be shown
- Set multiple union characters
